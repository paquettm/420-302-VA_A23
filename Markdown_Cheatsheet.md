# Markdown Cheatsheet

## Headers

Use "#" to create headers of different levels:

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

## Emphasis

Emphasize text using asterisks (*) or underscores (_):

- *Italic*: `*Italic*` or `_Italic_`
- **Bold**: `**Bold**` or `__Bold__`
- ***Bold and Italic***: `***Bold and Italic***`

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

Create unordered lists with asterisks (*), plus (+), or minus (-):

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Subitem 2.1
  * Subitem 2.2
```

### Ordered Lists

Create ordered lists with numbers:

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
   1. Subitem 2.1
   2. Subitem 2.2
```

## Links

Create hyperlinks with `[text](URL)`:

```
[OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)
```

## Images

Embed images with `![alt text](image URL)`:

```
![Markdown Logo](https://markdown-here.com/img/icon256.png)
```

## Blockquotes

Quote text with a greater-than sign (>):

```
> This is a blockquote.
```

## Code

Inline code with backticks (`):

```
Use `inline code` within your text.
```

Create code blocks by indenting with four spaces or using triple backticks (```):
```
&#96;`` 
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
&#96;`` 
```

## Horizontal Rule

Create a horizontal rule with three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:

```
---
```

## Tables

Create tables using pipes (|) and hyphens (-) for headers:

```
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Data 1   | Data 2   |
| Data 3   | Data 4   |
```

## Escaping Characters

To display characters that have special Markdown meanings, use a backslash (\) before them:

```
\*This won't be italic\*
```

## Line Breaks

Force a line break with two spaces at the end of a line:

```
This is the first line.  
This is the second line.
```

## Comments

Markdown doesn't have a native comment syntax, but you can use HTML comments:

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

This Markdown cheatsheet covers some of the most commonly used formatting elements. Markdown is versatile and can be extended with additional features depending on the platform you're using.
