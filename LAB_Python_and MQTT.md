## Laboratory: MQTT Communication with Python on Raspberry Pi

**Note: You previously installed Mosquitto as a MQTT message broker. The procedure was updated to show you how to configur Mosquitto to allow remote connections. Go back to [the procedure](LAB_MQTT_and_Mosquitto.md) to make sure that you do allow rmote connections.**

**Objective:**
This laboratory session builds upon the previous session, where you installed and tested Mosquitto on a Raspberry Pi. In this session, you will create Python programs to subscribe to and publish messages to the MQTT broker running on the Raspberry Pi. Additionally, you will connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH from your Windows or macOS command line.

**Materials:**
- Raspberry Pi 4 with Raspberry Pi OS installed and Mosquitto MQTT broker configured (as per the previous session).
- Windows or macOS computer.

**Procedure:**

**Connecting to the Raspberry Pi via SSH:**
1. **For Windows:**
    - Open the Command Prompt.
    - Use the `ssh` command to connect to your Raspberry Pi. Replace `<pi_username>` with your Raspberry Pi username and `<pi_ip>` with the Raspberry Pi's IP address.
    ```bash
    ssh <pi_username>@<pi_ip>
    ```
    
2. **For macOS:**
    - Open the Terminal.
    - Use the `ssh` command to connect to your Raspberry Pi using the same format as above.

**Python MQTT Subscriber:**
1. On the Raspberry Pi (via SSH), create and open a Python script for subscribing to MQTT messages. You can use the `nano` text editor or any other text editor you prefer.
   ```bash
   nano mqtt_subscriber.py
   ```

2. Copy and paste the following Python code into the `mqtt_subscriber.py` file. This code subscribes to an MQTT topic and displays incoming messages.
   ```python
   import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

   # Define the MQTT broker and topic
   broker_address = "localhost"  # Replace with the Raspberry Pi's IP if not running locally
   topic = "test/topic"  # Replace with the desired MQTT topic

   # Callback functions for MQTT client
   def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
       print("Connected to MQTT broker with result code " + str(rc))
       client.subscribe(topic)

   def on_message(client, userdata, message):
       print(f"Received message on topic '{message.topic}': {message.payload.decode()}")

   # Create an MQTT client
   client = mqtt.Client()

   # Set up callback functions
   client.on_connect = on_connect
   client.on_message = on_message

   # Connect to the MQTT broker
   client.connect(broker_address)

   # Start the MQTT client loop to receive messages
   client.loop_forever()
   ```

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Run the subscriber program on the Raspberry Pi via SSH:
   ```bash
   python3 mqtt_subscriber.py
   ```
   
**OOPS!**

If you've never worked with the `paho-mqtt` library, the program certainly failed to start and you saw errors at the command prompt.
When attempting to run your Python program, you might encounter the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/youraccountname/mqtt_subscriber.py", line 1, in <module>
    import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'paho'
```

**Error Explanation:**

This error message indicates a `ModuleNotFoundError`. Specifically, Python is unable to locate the `paho` module. The `paho` module is essential for MQTT communication in your program, and this error occurs when the module is not installed or not accessible within your Python environment. To resolve this issue, you should ensure that the `paho-mqtt` library is correctly installed in your Python environment as instructed earlier in the lab.

**Libraries**

Libraries contain pre-written code with functions designed to perform specific tasks in a programming language.
The Python community has developed numerous libraries to extend Python's capabilities for various applications.
To utilize these libraries, they must be installed as part of the configuration process for the Python runtime environment.

**Solution**

In our laboratory session, we will install the `paho-mqtt` library.
This library is essential for our tasks, enabling us to work with the MQTT protocol in Python.
Before running the provided programs, it's crucial to install the `paho-mqtt` library using `pip`.
Use the following command for installation:

```bash
pip install paho-mqtt
```
This will ensure that the essential MQTT functionality is made accessible for your Python programs, enabling you to interact with MQTT brokers effectively.
With `paho-mqtt` successfully installed, the library is now available for all future Python projects on the operating system installed on your Raspberry Pi's SD card.

**Python MQTT Publisher:**
1. On the Raspberry Pi (via SSH), create and open a Python script for publishing MQTT messages. Use the `nano` text editor or your preferred text editor.
   ```bash
   nano mqtt_publisher.py
   ```

2. Copy and paste the following Python code into the `mqtt_publisher.py` file. This code publishes random numbers to an MQTT topic every second.
   ```python
   import paho.mqtt.publish as publish
   import random
   import time

   # Define the MQTT broker and topic
   broker_address = "localhost"  # Replace with the Raspberry Pi's IP if not running locally
   topic = "test/topic"  # Replace with the desired MQTT topic

   while True:
       try:
           # Generate a random number between 0 and 100
           random_number = random.randint(0, 100)

           # Publish the random number to the MQTT topic
           publish.single(topic, payload=str(random_number), hostname=broker_address)

           print(f"Published: {random_number}")

           # Wait for one second before publishing the next number
           time.sleep(1)
       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           print("Publishing stopped.")
           break
   ```

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Run the publisher program on the Raspberry Pi via SSH:
   ```bash
   python3 mqtt_publisher.py
   ```

**Review Questions:**
1. How did you connect to the Raspberry Pi from your Windows or macOS command line?
2. Explain the purpose of the MQTT subscriber program.
3. What is the role of the MQTT publisher program?
4. How can you modify the MQTT topic and message payload in the publisher program to suit your needs?
5. What are the key components of the MQTT Python programs you created, and what is their purpose?
6. How could these MQTT communication techniques be applied in real-world IoT projects?

Ensure you document your observations and any issues encountered during this laboratory exercise in your report.

**Challenge**

In our [previous lab](Controlling_LEDs_w_RPi_and_Python.md), we lit up led lights to accommodate a countup to 59.

1- Modify the publisher program to send random numbers from 0 to 63.

2- Modify the subscriber program to output the random number to the led lights as in the previous lab.

Hint: you may have to convert datatypes with the int() function to get this program working.
